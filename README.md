# toys.harry.city

In the summer of 2018 I made three web app toys for `harry.city` which are since no longer hosted. This repo contains the image bleeder, the t-shirt generator and the fake tweet generator. None of them compile anymore due to missing components that now won't compile in 2020 so I've included `/dist` in each folder which contains the complete built project circa 2018. Going to a folder in your terminal and typing `python3 -m http.server` or `serve` (npm module) will host them locally.
